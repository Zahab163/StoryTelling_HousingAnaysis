# üè° Storytelling Assignment: Explore a Housing Prices Dataset Using Pandas

This project uncovers insights from a housing prices dataset through data storytelling. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore trends in property prices, area sizes, and bedroom counts to narrate the dynamics of the housing market.

## üß† Key Insights

### Housing Price Overview  
Prices vary widely, with a few luxury listings significantly raising the average. The distribution is skewed toward lower-priced homes, but outliers are present.

### Price Distribution and Outliers  
High kurtosis and skewness indicate a market with both affordable and premium properties. Outliers suggest opportunities for high-end investment.

### Property Area Analysis  
Most homes are moderately sized, but the presence of very large properties adds diversity to the market.

### Market Diversity  
The data reflects a dynamic housing market with no single dominant category. Buyers and sellers should consider the full range of options when making decisions.

##Further  Key Takeaways
- Price and area show wide variability and positive skew.
- Furnishing status significantly influences pricing.
- Visualizations like histograms, box plots, and violin plots reveal deep insights.
- Pair plots and heatmaps help uncover relationships between features.

## üìå Future Work

- Add location-based analysis (e.g., preferred areas)
- Explore correlation between amenities and pricing
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
